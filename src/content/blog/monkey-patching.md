# Why

I have a list of subjects, titles and ideas to make a post here. The first one is Monkey Patch, why? Because it's the only that appeared twice in the list and is the most recent addition, so LIFO it.

Before diving in, I wonder why it is called Monkey Patch, and by it I already associate with a monkey would do, but a monkey can't code...

## What is it?

I don't know exactly. The definition around is to make a code that behaves differently during runtime. Commonly I've read that monkey patching is not a bad thing per se, but how often and how mindful the patching is done. 

I feel that comparing it to a car is easier to understand. Let's take a car with those knobs to set the headlights. But then one day you decide to install flood lights to use offrad. But then you decided to put it in the same knob but it works only when the car's engine is running: The knob don't set the headlights, but the flood lights, if you want to turn of the headlights you must turn off the engine, then go at it again.

So let's take a software, by this example is clear to see that you would need to restart the application. One monkey patch may not be that bad, but imagine the same car, where you see the success of your first patching and you decide to add one more feature, control the flood light direction, well, since you already have this knob, why not just patch it again and attach it to another variable like "is the car parked?".

## Then...

You have the car at the garage and lend it to a friend without saying much. Then he goes to drive this car and is used to turn on the headlights after the car engine is on. You can see he will call you to say "Hey this is broken! Those floodlights blinds everyone, this is supposed to turn on the headlights right? Then it goes...

## So why do this?

Because you need. Because someone asked. Because is the only way. Because it's easier. Because you don't know better. Everything in code is around those same motifs. 

Ok, not everything. It's noy the only way, there's tradeoffs but this is a discussion for another post. Thanks for reading!
