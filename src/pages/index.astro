      <p>
        I like solving puzzles and challenges, it all started with highschool math, I discovered coding's endless challenges and
        fell in love when working in a paid media manager position, while
        working, I was seeking to solve a problem that the solution I need to
        code, so, while into this I learnt just enough to solve it, but more
        than enough to enjoy and want more.
