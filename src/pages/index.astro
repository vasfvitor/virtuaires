      <p>
        I like solving puzzles and problems, it all started with highschool
        math; Then a few years ago I discovered coding's endless challenges and
        fell in love when at a job I need to solve a problem that the solution
        needed code; so, while into this, I learnt just enough to solve it, but
        more than enough to enjoy and want more.

         PWA works offline, on mobile, and can be installed as an app:
        <Image src={sane3} alt="GIF: Sane PDF invoice generator" />
         It was initially written in vanilla JavaScript with Workbox package,
        but recently was refactored to Vite + Svelte. While at it I kept asking
        myself how the original code was even working with a bunch of wrong
        function signatures and calls.

          alt="Tocatins (Brazilian State) flag and coat of arms"
        />
         Done as CS50x final project. Quiz and state management was written
        entirely in Typescript. Now I know all the flags from Brazil, even
        though I live there, I couldn't ID more than a few flags.

         This was actully a challenge since I had to learn the basics of day
        trading to be able to understand and translate the strategy to code. I'm
        grateful for all the support folks at MQL5 forum provided.

         This was really fun to do and get to know more about each Rune and it's
        meaning. It's something, isn't? Had to do a bit of research into the
        writing and history to use the right text font.
